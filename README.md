### Quick Start Guide (for recommended platform)
1. [Account/prerequisite setup]
2. [Exact CLI commands]
3. [Configuration files with examples]
4. [Deployment commands]
5. [Verification steps]

Automation Readiness
- Terraform complexity assessment
- CI/CD integration difficulty
- Recommended automation approach

**Hard Requirements:**

- Focus on platforms that don't require credit card for free tier (if any)
- Include exact CLI installation commands where needed
- Mention any vendor lock-in considerations
- Keep response under 1500 words
- Avoid technical jargon - explain acronyms on first use
- Must address SPA routing requirements (404 handling)
- Include estimated costs if traffic exceeds free tier limits
```

10. **Implementation Priority** (which services to deploy first and why)

---

## **YOUR TASK**

Provide a comprehensive AWS service selection guide that explains which services to use for each component of the e-commerce platform and detailed justifications for why each service is the best choice for this specific use case. Focus on service capabilities, cost-effectiveness, scalability characteristics, and how they work together to meet the high-availability and performance requirements.

**Focus on service selection rationale - explain WHY each AWS service is chosen over alternatives, what specific capabilities make it suitable for e-commerce workloads, and how different services complement each other in the overall architecture.**
```
 ## Responds:
```
## Executive Summary

This architecture leverages AWS's global infrastructure through a multi-region active-passive deployment, utilizing containerized microservices with EKS, globally distributed data with RDS cross-region replicas and DynamoDB Global Tables, and comprehensive security through WAF, Shield Advanced, and Zero Trust networking principles.

## Regional Strategy

**Primary Region: us-east-1 (N. Virginia)**

- Justification: Largest AWS service availability, lowest latency to CDN edge locations, most cost-effective for compute resources
- Houses primary write databases and main application workloads

**Secondary Region: eu-west-1 (Ireland)**

- Justification: GDPR compliance for European customers, strong connectivity to global undersea cables, comprehensive service availability
- Active read replicas with failover capabilities

**Tertiary Region: ap-southeast-1 (Singapore)**

- Justification: Strategic location for Asia-Pacific traffic, growing e-commerce market, excellent connectivity to regional users
- Read-only replicas for regional performance optimization

## Service Selection by Layer

### Compute Layer

**Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**

- **Why**: Superior for microservices architecture with built-in service mesh capabilities, seamless auto-scaling, and vendor lock-in mitigation
- **E-commerce Fit**: Handles variable workloads (catalog browsing vs. checkout spikes), enables independent service scaling, supports blue-green deployments
- **Alternative Consideration**: ECS is simpler but EKS provides better multi-cloud portability and richer ecosystem

**EC2 Instances (Mixed Instance Types)**

- **Why**: Graviton2 instances (c6g, m6g) offer 40% better price-performance for web workloads
- **E-commerce Fit**: Variable instance types handle different workload patterns - compute-optimized for catalog services, memory-optimized for recommendation engines
- **Cost Optimization**: Spot instances for batch processing (order fulfillment, reporting)

**AWS Fargate for EKS**

- **Why**: Serverless containers eliminate infrastructure management overhead, automatic scaling, pay-per-use model
- **E-commerce Fit**: Perfect for microservices that have unpredictable traffic patterns or need rapid scaling

### Load Balancing & Traffic Distribution

**Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

- **Why**: Layer 7 routing enables path-based routing for microservices, WebSocket support for real-time features, built-in WAF integration
- **E-commerce Fit**: Routes /api/cart to cart service, /api/payments to payment service, handles SSL termination with SNI support
- **Superiority**: More cost-effective than multiple Classic Load Balancers, better health check granularity

**Amazon Route 53**

- **Why**: Health check-based failover, geolocation routing for compliance, low latency routing for performance
- **E-commerce Fit**: Automatically routes European users to eu-west-1 for GDPR compliance, fails over to secondary regions during outages
- **Global Capability**: 100% uptime SLA, anycast network for DNS resolution speed

**Amazon CloudFront**

- **Why**: 400+ edge locations globally, dynamic content acceleration, real-time metrics, cost-effective bandwidth pricing
- **E-commerce Fit**: Caches product images and CSS globally, accelerates API responses through dynamic caching, reduces origin load by 60-80%
- **Security Integration**: Native Shield Standard protection, custom SSL certificate support

**Amazon API Gateway**

- **Why**: Built-in throttling, request/response transformation, comprehensive monitoring, native AWS service integration
- **E-commerce Fit**: Rate limiting prevents API abuse, request validation reduces backend processing, caching improves response times
- **Microservices Enablement**: Unified API interface for multiple backend services

## Database & Storage Services

**Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL (Multi-AZ + Cross-Region Read Replicas)**

- **Why**: ACID compliance for financial transactions, superior query performance for complex e-commerce queries, automated failover
- **E-commerce Fit**: Handles order processing, inventory management, customer data with transaction integrity
- **Scaling Strategy**: Read replicas in each region reduce latency, automated failover ensures <60 second recovery times
- **Alternative Analysis**: Aurora is more expensive but offers better scaling; PostgreSQL chosen for cost-effectiveness and proven reliability
